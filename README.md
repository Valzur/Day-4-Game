# Day 4 game

Just like the name Implies, this game the 4th of my 5 day challenge of A game a day,
essentially the game is a Conway's game of life replica, which is an application on cellular automata.
In other words, it's a simulation of cells where their life or death only depend on the neighbouring cells.

## Controls
You'll figure it out, no keyboard involved though :"D

## Installation

Simply download the game from the releases section and run "Day 4 Game.exe", 
or clone the entire repo if you'd like the source code :"D
